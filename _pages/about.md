I am Babak Jalalzadeh-Fard, a Research Assistant Professor and Environmental Data Scientist with over nine years of experience addressing the impacts of climate change on public health. My work combines data science, geospatial analysis, and environmental research to develop actionable insights for decision-makers.

With a background in interdisciplinary engineering, I specialize in programming (Python, R), spatial data science, and machine learning. My recent projects include creating public health tracking tools, developing a Drought Vulnerability Index for Nebraska, and designing COVID-19 decision support dashboards. I am passionate about using advanced data analytics and machine learning to support environmental and health-related decision-making.

Outside of research, I have served as a mentor, collaborated on educational initiatives, and published on climate and health. I am always open to exploring new challenges at the intersection of data science and environmental impact.
